In this project i remade 3 old c# projects and implemented an api using endpoints interfaces and services.

<p>Peer Reviewer: Leo Garcia</p>
<p>Peer Review: Swagger and Postman work well with the API, and the services throw out a default message as intended, particularly with Guess It and Restaurant Picker. The only critique I have is that hard mode's default message has an unnecesary "in" in its message, other than that, this program works well.</p>
